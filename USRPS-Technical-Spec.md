Project Specification: USRPS (Undergraduate Student Result Processing System)1. Executive SummaryUSRPS is a professional-grade Academic ERP designed for universities to manage the lifecycle of student results. It transitions traditional academic record-keeping into a high-performance, data-heavy SaaS environment.Design PhilosophyContext: Academic & Official.User Persona: Administrative staff (Daily use).Visual Goal: "University ERP meets modern SaaS."Optimization: High data density, fast scanning, and zero visual noise.2. Technical Stack (Recommended)LayerTechnologyKey Libraries/FeaturesBackendLaravel 10+ (PHP 8.2)Sanctum (Auth), Laravel Excel, DomPDF, Service Classes for GPA logicFrontendReact 18+ (Vite)Tailwind CSS, Headless UI/Radix, Recharts, React Hook FormDatabaseMySQL or PostgreSQLRelational integrity, Soft deletes, Indexing on Matric Numbers3. UI/UX ArchitectureLayout StructureSidebar (260px): Dark gradient (#0F172A → #020617), frosted-glass effect, rounded edges.Top Bar (64px): Sticky, white/blur background, breadcrumb navigation, and profile controls.Content Area: Soft gray background (#F8FAFC) with white elevated cards for data.Visual IdentityTypography: Inter / Poppins (Sans-serif).Color Palette:Primary: Navy / Slate Blue.Success: Teal.Warning: Amber.Danger: Red.4. Database Schema & Data Models4.1 Academic FoundationFaculties: id, nameDepartments: id, name, faculty_idAcademic Sessions: id, name (e.g., 2023/2024), status (active/closed)Courses: id, code, title, unit, semester (1/2), level, department_id4.2 User & Student EntitiesUsers: id, name, email, role (SuperAdmin, FacultyAdmin, DeptAdmin)Students: id, user_id, matric_number (unique), admission_year, current_level, status (active, spillover, graduated)4.3 Result EngineResults Table: \* Foreign Keys: student_id, course_id, session_id.Scores: first_ca (10), second_ca (10), attendance (5), assignment (5), exam (70).Computed: total, grade, grade_point, status.5. Core Business Logic (The "Engine")5.1 Grading ScaleThe system must use a configurable service class to handle grades:70–100: A (5.0)60–69: B (4.0)50–59: C (3.0)45–49: D (2.0)40–44: E (1.0)< 40: F (0.0)5.2 Calculations$$GPA = \frac{\sum (\text{Grade Point} \times \text{Course Unit})}{\sum (\text{Course Units})}$$Carryover Logic: Automatically flag failed courses for re-registration in the next available semester.Spillover Logic: Track students exceeding the standard residency duration.6. Functional Roadmap (Module Priority)Phase 1: The Foundation (CRUD)Dashboard: Statistical overview cards.Academic Structure: Faculty & Department management.User Management: Role-based access control.Phase 2: Academic CoreStudent Management: Profile creation and matriculation.Course Management: Building the syllabus/curriculum.Settings: Defining sessions and grading rules.Phase 3: The Result EngineCourse Registration: Linking students to specific courses/sessions.Result Entry: Manual forms + Bulk Excel uploads.Computation Service: Triggering GPA/CGPA calculations.Phase 4: OutputsReports: Departmental summaries.Transcript Generator: Official PDF generation with security features.7. API Design GuidelinesAll endpoints should follow the /api/v1/ prefix.GET /faculties - Fetch all faculties.POST /results/upload - Process Excel result sheets.GET /students/{id}/transcript - Stream PDF transcript.8. Development Implementation Checklist (For AI Agent)[ ] Initialize Laravel with Sanctum for SPA authentication.[ ] Setup Migrations with strict Foreign Key constraints.[ ] Create a ResultService.php class for all mathematical computations.[ ] Build React Sidebar with framer-motion for smooth transitions.[ ] Implement Laravel-Excel for student and result imports.
